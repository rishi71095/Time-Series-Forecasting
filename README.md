# Time Series Forecasting with a dataset from Statistics Canada

This repository documents my learning journey in time series forecasting using a custom dataset from Statistics Canada. The goal is to build a hands-on understanding of time series concepts by applying them step-by-step to a real-world dataset of my choice.

## What's Covered

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  Basic visualization and understanding of trends, seasonality, and patterns in the data.

- Baseline Forecasting Models  
  - Mean Forecast  
  - Naive Forecast  
  - Seasonal Naive Forecast  
  - Drift Method

- Statistical Properties of Time Series  
  - Understanding and identifying stationarity  
  - Using ACF (Autocorrelation Function) and PACF to analyze dependencies  
  - Testing for Random Walks using statistical tests like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test

- Making the Series Stationary  
  - Applying differencing  
  - Re-checking for stationarity  
  - Transforming the series for modeling

- Forecasting Models  
  - AutoRegressive (AR) Models  
  - Moving Average (MA)  
  - ARMA / ARIMA as applicable

## Learning Outcome

This project is part of my self-guided exploration of time series forecasting. The focus is not just on model performance, but on deeply understanding why and when to use certain models, and how to interpret patterns in the data.
